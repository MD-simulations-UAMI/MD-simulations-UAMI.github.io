It's possible to use WordPress as a headless CMS and some headless CMS have implemented some sort of an alternative. Prismic has Slices (unfortunately you can’t create multiple repeatable fields within fields).</p>\n<p>For smaller projects WordPress or Prismic may be too complex. In such cases, I usually go with my favorite flat-file CMS - Netlify CMS.</p>\n<p>Netlify CMS offers everything you need, it’s open-source and free to use. The only thing missing? Flexible Content field. Fortunately, with beta features - Manual Initialization and Variable Types for List fields we can easily create a solution that copies ACF's Flexible Content.</p>\n<h2>Why using flexible content is a great idea?</h2>\n<p>Advanced Custom Fields' Flexible Content allows editors to quickly make significant changes without engaging developers. Creating new pages is a breeze, and optimizing for conversions is easier.</p>\n<p>Using a singular template may not be the best way to organize your content, especially if you want to quickly test new changes. That's why component-based, modular design gives you much more flexibility.</p>\n<p>It lowers development and maintenance costs. Websites are tools that have to generate business value. The better system you build the longer it’ll last without any code changes.</p>","frontmatter":{"id":"44d0d78e-1f11-4f92-85ac-d144d60bb573","title":"Philosophy behind Henlo.","author":"a1d1172a-8736-47c1-831d-3e508729fee2","seo":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"90c40979-4a51-5bf5-825c-bc7bc88d9f6a"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
